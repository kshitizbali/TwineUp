1) Used random Api  for populating the main list (Constrain)
2) Used demo list in project for second screen(Actvity Screen) (Constrain)
3) Added some UI touches (Which added small amount of time) such as drawables icons, textview status change,
custom dialog on item click.
4) Maintained dimensions
5) Two screens only (Assumption)
6) No click on activity screen, already shows the activity no detail required (Assumption)
7) Project took a little more time, i hope it was worth it (In my opinion, it was :) )
